  "description": "Nowadays, we get most of our information from visualized content such as images and videos. But when you find something you want to remember, you still have to manually enter all the information somewhere. Because of this, some people only save screenshots without notes. However, this is not a good practice as it is easy to forget why you saved the screenshot. The most effective way is to take a screenshot, paste it into the Notes app, and add a note. However, this is not efficient because you have to use both the screenshot tool and the memo tool and you have to see both the image and the text to know what you want to remember. Capture Note was created to solve this inconvenience."
