  "description": "In these days we get most of the information from visualized contents like image or video. But when you find the information want to remember, unfortunately, there is no easy way to save them. You have to write or type all the information somewhere. Some people take the screenshots and add it to the note app. It may be easy but this way people can't remember what is the information to remember because image include so many information."
