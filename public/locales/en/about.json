  "h1": "About Capture Note",
  "description": "Capture Note is an app that makes it easy to capture, organize, and share important information from visual content such as images and videos. With Capture Note, users can quickly take a screenshot or import an image, add notes directly onto the image, and easily organize and categorize the notes. This eliminates the need to manually enter information or rely on separate screenshot and note-taking tools. Capture Note allows you to keep all the information in one place, making it easy to remember why you saved the screenshot and improving the efficiency of information management.",
  "description_draft": "Nowadays, we get most of our information from visualized content such as images and videos. But when you find something you want to remember, you still have to manually enter all the information somewhere. Because of this, some people only save screenshots without notes. However, this is not a good practice as it is easy to forget why you saved the screenshot. The most effective way is to take a screenshot, paste it into the Notes app, and add a note. However, this is not efficient because you have to use both the screenshot tool and the memo tool and you have to see both the image and the text to know what you want to remember. Capture Note was created to solve this inconvenience."
